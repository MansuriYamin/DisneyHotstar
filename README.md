# Disney+ Hotstar Replica

This project is a work-in-progress replica of the Disney+ Hotstar app, focusing on displaying
movies. The UI design is heavily inspired
by [Disney But Better](https://www.behance.net/gallery/141700011/Disney-But-Better) on Behance. It
is built using Jetpack Compose, the modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps.
